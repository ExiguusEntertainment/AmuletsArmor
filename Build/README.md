# Build Helpers

This directory contains helper scripts and files for building
Amulets & Armor.

## Running Tests

A simple regression test for some geometry helper functions can be
run using `run_tests.sh`.

```sh
./run_tests.sh
```

The script builds `tests/test_distance.c` with a standard C compiler
and executes the resulting binary.
